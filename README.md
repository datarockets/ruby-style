# Datarockets::Style [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/datarockets-style.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/datarockets-style)

Datarockets shared style configs and notes of code-style conventions. Based on the [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) util.

This config enforces many of the guidelines outlined in the datarockets [Ruby Style Guide](doc/STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem 'datarockets-style', '~> 1.4.0'
end
```

Or, for a Ruby library, add this to your gemspec:

```ruby
spec.add_development_dependency 'datarockets-style', '~> 1.4.0'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

Create a `.rubocop.yml` with the following directives:


### Ruby application

This config includes specific rules for Ruby application. It works for Ruby gems and no-Rails applications.

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  datarockets-style:
    - config/ruby.yml
```

### Rails application

For Rails applications, you can use a specific Rails instead of Ruby config

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  datarockets-style:
    - config/rails.yml
```

By default, it doesn't include rules for I18n. For enabling them, add the next styles

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  datarockets-style:
    - config/rails.yml
    - config/rails-locales.yml
```

### Rspec config

For Rspec tests, you can add a special rubocop config

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  datarockets-style:
    - config/ruby.yml
    - config/rspec.yml
```

Now, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

You do not need to include rubocop directly in your application's dependencies. Datarockets-style will include a specific version of `rubocop` and `rubocop-rspec` that is shared across all projects.

### Configurable cops

There are some areas in which there is no clear consensus in datarockets team regarding a particular style (like string literal quoting).
In such scenarios, all popular styles are acknowledged and it’s up to you to pick one and apply it consistently.
For that just set up these cops before starting of usage.

#### RSpec/LetSetup

[This cop](https://rubocop-rspec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cops_rspec/#rspecletsetup) is enabled by default and we suggest not to use unreferenced `let` variables in your test cases.
However, if it feels like the cop should be enabled and tests can't be written w/o them, please create an issue with your cases so that we can re-thinking our solution about enabling this cop.

#### Style/StringLiterals

There are two popular styles in the Ruby community, both of which are considered good - single quotes by default and double quotes by default.
There is no clear consensus about this style in the Ruby community and in the datarockets team.
So we suggest just to set up a [preferable style](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cops_style/#stylestringliterals) before running this gem.

P.S. The string literals in this gem are using double quotes by default.

##### Tips

For an existing project, we suggest running rubocop with both styles and choose which has fewer offenses (which is more popular in the current project).

### Custom cops

We have custom cops. You can find specification for them [here](manual).

## Formatters

### ToDo list formatter

This formatter allows us to get list of files for some offense and with number of offenses in each file. This file can be useful if you need to fix a large some cop step by step.

Result of the formatter is compatible with rubocop config or rubocop todo file.

For running that cop, just print in your command like

```bash
$ bundle exec rubocop -f TodoListFormatter -r datarockets_style
Inspecting 10 files
...CC.CC..
10 files inspected, 7 offenses detected

```

#### Autocorrection

If you run the formatter with autocorrection options, the formatter skip corrected cop and does not include it to the result.

```bash
$ bundle exec rubocop -f TodoListFormatter -r datarockets_style -a
Inspecting 10 files
...CC.CC..
10 files inspected, 7 offenses detected, 1 offenses corrected

```

## Non-goals of RuboCop

### Rspec configuration

RSpec-core library provides some configuration rules which provides some linting rules itself. Read more about it in [RuboCop Rspec non-goals topic](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec#non-goals-of-rubocop-rspec).
